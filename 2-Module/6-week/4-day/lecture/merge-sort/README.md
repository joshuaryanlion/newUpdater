# Practice Merge Sort

In this practice exercise, you will be implementing a merge sort based on
provided pseudocode.

## Instructions

1. Clone the [starter] repo
2. Install all packages by typing `npm install`
3. Read through the instructions and specs to understand the task
4. Run specs with `npm test`
5. Implement the code in `merge-sort.js`.

## Polya's Problem Solving

Remember Polya's problem solving framework as you go through these exercises.

1. Understand the problem
2. Make a plan
3. Carry out the plan
4. Look back and improve your solution

You will be implementing classic algorithms in code. Review the readings to
_understand the problem_.

You are given the _plan_ in comments already. Study these carefully!

These exercises are meant for you to practice _carrying out the plan_. Focus
on translating the plans to JavaScript code.

If you finish early, you will be able to _improve your solutions_ by
refactoring your sorting algorithms to run in-place.

## Part 1: Merge Sort

Read through the pseudocode to implement merge sort.

This exercise makes use of `console.log` to make sure that your
implementations of merge sort is correct. Note each intermediate state of the
arrays in `test/merge-sort-specs.js`.

If you follow the pseudocode, your `console.log` outputs will match the order
in the specs.

**BONUS** Time and plot the performance on a Google Sheet.
